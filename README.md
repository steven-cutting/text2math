A very simple package that implements a very simple method for generating ngrams and a bag of words representation from any given text.

The main purpose of this package is to provide a demonstration of three things:
  - Programing in a "more" Functional style in Python using the toolz library.
  - Using pytest for Test Driven Development.
  - Using Docker to run tests in a clean environment and against different versions of dependencies/python versions.
